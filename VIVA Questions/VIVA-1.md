* **Answer:** Agglomerative is a "bottom-up" approach where each record starts as its own cluster and they merge until one cluster remains. Divisive is a "top-down" approach where all records start in one cluster and are split into smaller clusters.



**Q9. What is a Scree Plot used for in Factor Analysis?**

* **Answer:** A Scree Plot visualizes the Eigen values against the number of factors. It helps determine the optimal number of factors to retain by looking for the "elbow" or the point where the curve flattens (usually factors with Eigen value > 1).



**Q10. Why is Naive Bayes called "Naive"?**

* 
**Answer:** It is called "Naive" because it assumes that all predictor (independent) variables are independent of each other, which is a strong and often unrealistic assumption in real-world data.
