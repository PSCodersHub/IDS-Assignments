# 📊 Assignment 1 – Data Creation & Preprocessing
---

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this assignment is to perform **data creation, cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization** on a given dataset using Python. The assignment focuses on handling missing values, detecting outliers, and understanding data distribution using standard data analytics techniques.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
**Dataset Name:** `StudentsPerformance.csv`

The dataset contains student performance data with attributes such as:
- Math_Score
- Reading_Score
- Writing_Score
- Other categorical attributes

No additional attributes were created; the analysis was performed strictly on the given dataset.

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `pandas` – Data handling and preprocessing  
- `numpy` – Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` – Data visualization  
- `scipy` – Statistical analysis (Z-score)

---

## 🧪 Concepts & Functions Covered

### 1. Missing Value Detection
- `isnull()`
- `notnull()`

### 2. Missing Value Handling
- `fillna(0)`
- `fillna(mean)`
- `fillna(median)`
- `fillna(standard deviation)`
- `fillna(min)`
- `fillna(max)`
- `dropna()`

### 3. Data Replacement
- `replace()` for categorical data handling

### 4. Statistical Measures
- Mean
- Median
- Skewness (to check if data is skewed)

### 5. Data Visualization
- **Boxplot** – Outlier detection
- **Scatterplot** – Relationship between variables

### 6. Outlier Detection Techniques
- **Z-Score (Z-scope)**
- **Inter Quartile Range (IQR)**

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Identification of missing values in the `Math_Score` column
- Demonstration of multiple imputation techniques
- Replacement of categorical values for consistency
- Detection of skewness and outliers
- Visualization of data distribution and relationships
- Comparison of statistical measures before and after preprocessing
