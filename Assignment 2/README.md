## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic machine learning on the **Titanic dataset** using Python. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, extract insights, and build simple models to predict survival.

The project is divided into **two main parts**, each using a different dataset:

1. **Part 1 – Seaborn’s Built-in Titanic Dataset**
   Uses the standard Titanic dataset provided by the Seaborn library for basic exploration and visualization.

2. **Part 2 – Kaggle Titanic Train Dataset (`titanic_train.csv`)**
   Uses the official Kaggle dataset to perform deeper preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

## 📊 Part 1 — Analysis Using Seaborn Titanic Dataset

In this section, the dataset is loaded directly from Seaborn. Typical steps include:

✔ Importing and previewing data
✔ Understanding data shape and missing values
✔ Visualizing distributions and relationships
✔ Interpreting patterns across features such as Sex, Age, Pclass, and Survived

## 🧠 Part 2 — Kaggle Titanic Dataset

This section covers:

📌 Loading `titanic_train.csv`
📌 Same as the Part 1
📌 Encoding categorical variables
---

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the Google Colab link above.
2. Upload `titanic_train.csv` when prompted (if not already in Colab).
3. Run all notebook cells sequentially.
4. Inspect charts, outputs, and model results.

## 📌 Notes

* The Kaggle dataset contains more detailed fields and requires preprocessing.
* Seaborn’s dataset is cleaner and useful for initial exploration.
